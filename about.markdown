#Hello, I'm Reuben Ingber! A self-taught web developer with an eye for design.

<br>

### It's a pleasure to meet you, here is a little about me. 

I built my first websites, in the late 90's and early 2000's using a combination of Geocities & Blogger. I wanted a place on the internet to call home, but always envisioned the web as a hobby and *not* a career. 

After college, I moved to Washington, D.C. to get my masters degree in government and worked as a lobbyist for the [American Israel Public Affairs Committee](http://aipac.org). 

####Finally after playing on the web for years, I made the decision to jump to working on the web full time. I spent a few years teaching myself front-end development and design. 

Today, I am a full time front-end engineer at [Business Insider](http://businessinsider.com). I work on developing components for all of Business Insider's properties and I've been apart of the launch teams for [Business Insider Deutchland](http://businessinsider.de/?IR=C) and [Tech Insider](http://techinsider.io) 

Previously, I was a developer at [ExpandTheRoom](http://expandtheroom.com), a small web development and design agency. 

I have worked with clients like Scholastic Books, Nielsen, Rolling Stone Magazine, The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Reuters and many others. You can view some of my latest work, [here](/work).

> I am a skilled front end web developer and designer with a focus on modular HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.

I have developed custom marketing sites, email templates, custom Wordpress themes, and much more.  I write modern and well organized code that enhances performance and user experience. I have the ability to learn and implement new technologies rapidly.

Outside of work, I host a podcast called [How to Hold a Pencil](http://howtoholdapencil.com) (currently on hiatus). In 2014 I ran the New York City Marathon and intend to do another marathon soon. I love spending time with my wife exploring the New York cities amazing restaurants and binge watching stuff Netflix. 

I was born and raised in New York city and currently live on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
