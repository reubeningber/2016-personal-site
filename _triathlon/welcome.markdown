Hi, if you can't tell from the URL, I'm Reuben Ingber by day I am a web developer at [Business Insider](http://businessinsider.com) and by night I try to challenge myself. In 2014, I successfully completed the New York City Marathon in 5:15:59. Since then I haven't done much in terms of physical fitness. I tried to keep running, but it got boring and I really started to hate it. I tried the gym and again I just wasn't enjoying it. About 2 months ago, I started to get this crazy idea of trying a triathlon. 

> A ton of people have told me, if you can do a marathon you can do a triathlon. 

Before I continue you have to realize I was never athletic, and do not think I will ever consider myself to be an athlete. I am guy who through shear will and determination completes things. About 5 years ago, while in Washington, D.C. I watched the Marine Marathon. As I sat on the corner in Georgetown, eating a bagel, I looked at each of the runners and continuously thought to myself well if that guy can do it so can I. 

Conveniently for me last year, I watched the NYC Triathlon runners
